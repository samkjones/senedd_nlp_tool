8,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.14,This evidence paper addresses the questions posed by the committee in annex 2 of the commissioning letter.,?
9,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.51,It is largely based on the paper that we presented to Welsh Government in a meeting of the Finance Sub Group on 25th October.,?
10,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.44,Most of it comprised our assessment of local government spending pressures that have remained persistently high over the current financial year.,?
11,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.37,We have updated our estimates of the pressures in 23-24 and 24-25 based on local authorities’ medium-term financial plans.,?
12,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.58,These are based on the results of a full survey of councils and fire services carried out during August/September with the help of the Society of Welsh Treasurers (SWT).,?
13,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.25,"Since the Finance Sub Group paper was presented to the group, we have become aware of two further developments.",?
14,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.34,"Firstly, the publication of the Autumn Statement by the UK Government signaled an increase in employer contributions for the teachers’ pension scheme of 5%, from 23.6% to 28.6% from 1st April 2024 which will cost £64.3m.",?
15,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.31,These costs have been based on no increase to pay for 2024/25 academic year.,?
16,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.34,A similar revaluation of the fire and rescue services pension scheme will lead to an overall increase in employer contributions for FRAs from 1st April 2024 of £2.8m.,?
17,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.39,"However most local authorities are assuming that this is fully funded, as it was at the last revaluation.",?
18,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.4,"Secondly, at the end of October, we became aware that part of the teachers pay award for would not be funded on a recurrent basis from This puts an additional unfunded pressure of £21.3m on next year’s budget despite an assurance that it was fully funded in the Minister’s letter of 9th March 2023.",?
19,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.08,Conclusion 5.,?
20,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.19,This means we can reprofile the estimates contained in the original report.,?
21,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.45,In local authorities will face an estimated pressure of £809m rather than £720m.,?
22,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.25,In it will be £604m and £613m in 6.,?
23,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.44,"If the pensions contributions are funded but the pay pressure is not, the aggregate annual budget gap in each of the next 3 years is £432m, £429m and £433m in the run up to In total, the cumulative funding gap could potentially be £1.294bn.",?
24,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.43,The measures that councils will take to address this gap will have to be drastic.,?
25,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.22,The pressure next year is around 2.5 times the pressures that we would ordinarily expect to see and figure 1 above shows how these are spread over the broad service areas.,?
26,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.55,"Social care accounts for 36% (£261m) of pressure in 24-25, schools account for 23% (£164m) of the pressure and other the local authority services account for the remaining 41% (£295m).",?
27,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.1,The full break down is set out in Annex I.,?
28,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.38,"While the pressures in the current financial year were offset by a better-than- expected settlement, it is becoming clear that there are additional in-year pressures amounting to £219m.",?
29,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.07,This is set out in more detail in Annex II.,?
30,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.4,"In some authorities, these projected overspends have become particularly acute with a range of measures being implemented to balance budgets.",?
31,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.54,"In terms of a service breakdown, social care makes up 50% of the overspend, or £109m, with high-cost children’s care and soaring demand for adults’ social care accounting for most of the runaway costs.",?
32,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.32,"Education and schools accounts for around 22%, or £47m of the total overspend.",?
33,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.51,Other council services account for the £63m which is just under 30% or the overall overspend.,?
34,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.4,"Viewed another way, just over a third of projected overspend, around £72m, is due to inflation (including pay inflation), which is much higher than originally anticipated when budgets were set in early 2023.",?
35,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.6,"However much of the in-year pressures arise from unanticipated demand, especially in social care, and accounts for 50% or £109m (which is, coincidentally, the same as the total social care pressure).",?
36,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.31,"On the funding side, the planned increases in Aggregate External Finance (AEF) for is £169m, or 3.1%, which will cover just over a quarter of the pressure in the financial year.",?
37,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.67,"The latest estimates from Wales Fiscal Analysis for subsequent years shows the outlook on funding to be particularly bleak, with councils relying mostly on council tax for any additional funding.",?
38,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.58,"Without additional funding, the risk to council services including education and social care cannot be overstated.",?
39,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.37,"The aggregate annual budget gap in each of the next 3 years is £411m, £408m and £412m in the run up to In total, the cumulative funding gap could potentially be £1.232bn.",?
40,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.45,"Some of the gap will be met through efficiencies and other measures but given the scale of the challenge, many councils are bracing for large scale service cuts and a loss of posts that will run into thousands.",?
41,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.08,Analysis 8.,?
42,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.54,The Welsh Government has described its budgetary position as “the most difficult financial situation since the dawn of devolution”.,?
43,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.24,"Over the summer, cabinet ministers were asked to look at the in-year position in in preparation for the budget round.",?
44,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.45,"While the picture for next year is bleak, Wales Fiscal 12.",?
45,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.4,"The three National Joint Council for Local Government Services (NJC LGS) unions (UNISON, GMB and Unite) tabled their pay claim for local government services (‘Green Book’) employees for on 30 January 2023.",?
46,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.51,The claim states that council workers have ‘…endured a decade of below average pay awards and pay freezes…[and]…have lost on average 25% from the value of their pay spine since 2010.,?
47,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.44,"The pay claim is set in the context of the cost-of-living crisis, inflationary pressures, recruitment and retention challenges.",?
48,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.35,"In February 2023, the national employers responded to the unions pay claim with a full and final offer of £1,925 for all points on the NJC pay spine and 3.88% for all pay points above the top of the NJC pay spine.",?
49,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.37,"For the lowest paid (currently earning £20,441 per annum), the offer equates to an increase of 9.42 per cent this year; meaning their pay will have increased by £4,033 (22.0 per cent) over the two years since April 2021.",?
50,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.1,The three NJC LGS trade unions declined the offer and balloted members for industrial action.,?
51,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.33,Local Government Employers have maintained the offer is full and final.,?
52,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.2,"All three NJC LGS trade unions undertook disaggregated ballots at the local level, on an individual council or service basis, rather than a national ballot.",?
53,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.17,Members from Unison the largest trade union did not return a vote for industrial action and are understood to be keen to see a swift resolution so that the pay award is applied as soon as possible.,?
54,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.28,"Unite returned a positive vote for industrial action in three councils, overall membership numbers are low but are concentrated in services, such as waste and street scene, with strike action causing some disruption as a consequence in two of the three councils.",?
55,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.06,"The ballot for GMB, the second largest trade union, is due to close on 24 October 2023 and Local Government Employers are due to meet on 2 November 2023 to discuss next steps.",?
56,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.14,If GMB fails to secure a vote for industrial action then it is hoped that the pay award will be accepted and the current dispute brought to a close.,?
57,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.41,Industrial action by Teachers in February 2023 led to the Welsh Government opening negotiations on pay and workload.,?
58,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.34,"The School Teachers Pay and Conditions (Wales) Document for 2022/23 was updated in April 2023 to increase the pay award from the previously agreed 5% to 6.5% and provide for an additional 1.5% non - consolidated lump sum for 2022/23 only, backdated to 01 September 2022.",?
59,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.38,"The School Teachers Pay and Conditions (Wales) document for 2023/24 was laid on 05 October 2023 and is anticipated to come into force at the end of October, this will also include a revised pay award, increased from the proposed 3.5% to 5% for 2023/24, backdated to 01 September 2023.",?
60,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.3,The JNC for Youth and Community Workers pay award agreed an increase of £1925 from 01 September 2022 and the Employers Side has received a pay and conditions claim from the Staff Side Trade Unions for 2023.,?
61,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.23,The headline element of the claim is for a pay increase of RPI + 2%.,?
62,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.05,Discussions are ongoing.,?
63,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.16,The National Employers remains in dispute with the Soulbury Officers’ Side on pay for 2022.,?
64,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.27,The National Employers made an offer of £1925 in November 2022 and have been unable to reach a pay agreement.,?
65,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.12,The Association of Educational Psychologists (AEP) undertook a ballot and have voted for industrial action.,?
66,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.29,"Employers have made a final offer on pay which includes an increase of £1,925 on all pay points with effect from 1 September 2022 and an increase of 3.5% on all pay points with effect from 1 September 2023.",?
67,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.3,The NJC for Local Authority Fire and Rescue Services (LAFRS) reached agreement on pay awards for 2022 and 2023 in March 2023.,?
68,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.14,These represent an increase of 7% effective from 01 July 2022 and 5% effective from 01 July 2023.,?
69,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.28,The NJC for Brigade Managers of LAFRS reached agreement on pay awards for 2022 and 2023 on 31 May 2023.,?

71,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.17,"The JNC for Coroners agreed a pay award of 1.56% for 2022/23, effective 01 April 2022.",?
72,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.55,"In terms of non-pay inflation, the estimated costs faced by councils in remains stubbornly high at around £125m, whereas previous surveys have shown the historic position is around half of that.",?
73,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.17,The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) stated in March 2023 that it expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation to have peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022 - at its highest rate in around 40 years.,?
74,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.15,"The increase was driven mostly by higher gas prices feeding into sharp rises in domestic energy bills, alongside higher fuel prices and global goods inflation.",?
75,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.08,Inflation is still expected to fall rapidly to around 0 per cent from mid-2024 to mid- 2026.,?
76,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.16,Energy bills will fall back and some global supply pressures reverse.,?
77,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.12,The OBR expects inflation to then return to the 2 per cent target by the end of the forecast as the large swings in energy prices fall out of the annual CPI calculation and output is broadly in line with the economy’s productive potential.,?
78,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.26,"Figure 3: Office for Budget Responsibility’s March 2023 CPI Forecast, % Source: ONS, OBR 24.",?
79,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.16,"However, the published September CPI is not behaving in the way forecast.",?
80,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.06,"While food prices saw their first monthly fall in two years, fuel prices rose sharply.",?
81,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.09,"The consequence is that the overall rate of inflation held steady at 6.7%, ending a run of three consecutive monthly falls.",?
82,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.24,"Furthermore, the Bank of England’s latest forecast (August 2023) expects inflation to keep on falling in 2024 and reach their 2% target in the first half of 2025.” Education and Schools 25.",?
83,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.52,"Councils have reported £41m of in-year pressures for that have been added to school budgets, with a quarter of this due to pay.",?
84,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.37,The future pressure that schools are facing is £164m in which represents a 5.6% increase on budgeted net revenue expenditure2 for Annual pressure builds in subsequent years with a further £134m and £131m in 25-26 and 26-27 respectively.,?
85,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.26,Pay accounts for over 70% of total inflation in each of the years.,?
86,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.19,Many authorities have rightly assumed that the additional grants for the teachers pay deal in 22-23 and in 23-24 will be funded on a recurrent basis with the grants transferred into the funding baseline.,?
87,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.32,A similar assumption is being made for anticipated changes in the employer rate for teachers’ pensions.,?
88,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.3,"In the past, funding has come from the Treasury when the rate has increased.",?
89,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.44,Even the councils that have protected schools in recent years say that they cannot be given the same support in the future given the scale of funding gap.,?
90,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.33,Some have identified additional financial pressures on specific schools which are linked to deprivation and significant Additional Learning Needs (ALN) demands.,?
91,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.48,Some 2 Schools and education net revenue expenditure is budgeted at £2.941bn in (Source: Welsh Government RA Returns) returns reflect on how head teachers are starting to report of the devastating effect of cuts on educational standards - in particular the pastoral/wrap around work that schools undertake.,?
92,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.27,"The aftermath of the pandemic and high energy costs continues to place additional pressures on schools, and some report that they are reviewing the impact the pandemic is still having on ALN, attendance and behaviour.",?
93,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.21,However in broad terms schools are beginning to burn through reserves at such a rate that they are seeking loans to cover shortfalls as one response put it: “…..school balances are expected to reduce by 50% in year.,?
94,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.19,It is anticipated therefore than there will be many more schools seeking a loan arrangement in 24-25.” 29.,?
95,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.39,Most councils operate a system of Licenced Deficit Agreements and make assumptions around future funding levels.,?
96,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.19,The prospect of some making it back into surplus are starting to look hopeless.,?
97,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.14,"One authority reports that along with this, the majority, if not all of their other schools will fall into deficit.",?
98,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.22,Some of their small schools will become unsustainable because pupil/teacher ratios would fall to unacceptable levels.,?
99,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.38,Many councils are now reporting a significant risk of redundancy for support staff and teachers.,?
100,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.24,It concluded by saying that this cycle would escalate under current circumstances with more teachers being made redundant and some schools being unable to meet recommended pupil /teacher ratios.,?
101,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.28,There were many comments about how the sustainability of numerous small schools will need to be reviewed as financial pressures persist.,?
102,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.31,"However, the increased cost of transport to neighbouring schools could negate savings made especially in rural areas.",?
103,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.12,One authority reported how a review of 6th form provision is also in the pipeline.,?
104,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.33,The financial sustainability of the current provision will be considered as part of this review.,?
105,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.25,"Significant additional risks and pressures in schools remain in respect of Additional Learning Needs (ALN) provision, increased number of pupils in special education, resource bases and facilities to support pupils with social and emotional difficulties.",?
106,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.14,Part of this is thought to be linked to the after-effects of the pandemic.,?
107,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.3,The increased needs and complexity of pupils is not reflected in the funding.,?
108,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.33,Social care 32.,?
109,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.56,Councils continue to be extremely concerned about the current pressures facing social care.,?
110,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.55,"The survey responses demonstrate the continuing impact of growing demographic, cost of living, workforce and inflationary pressures facing all parts of the social care system.",?
111,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.34,"Increasing demand for services, and the increasing complexity add to these pressures and concerns.",?
112,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.47,"The impact is that budgets are not stretching as far, families and unpaid carers are facing further strains, and recruitment and retention remain huge challenges.",?
113,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.38,The SWT survey shows the significant in-year pressures being experienced across both adults and children’s services.,?
114,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.61,The survey identified £109m worth of in-year pressures in social care which is around 4.7% of budgeted net revenue expenditure3.,?
115,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.57,This builds on a £93m overspend on social services in the previous financial year.,?
116,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.25,The considerable financial challenges continue into and beyond.,?
117,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.42,Next financial year there is a £261m pressure which represents an 11.3% increase in current budgets.,?
118,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.33,"Commissioning costs and pay and non-pay inflation account for £180m of the pressure, and the remainder is down to demand which accounts for £81m.",?
119,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.29,"There is an additional £187m in 25-26, and £198m in 26-27 respectively giving a cumulative total of £646m.",?
120,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.55,"Commissioned services, which are essential to the provision of social care, from independent providers are also affected by similar issues to local authority social care services with increased running costs for staffing and energy, as well as increases in relation to insurance and fuel which are further adding to significant financial pressure.",?
121,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.56,"Combined with increasing demand, complexity of need and workforce shortages this has resulted in higher costs and therefore increased expenditure for councils to meet the increasing costs of placements across both adults and children’s services.",?
122,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.24,Local authorities have flagged this as a significant risk.,?
123,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.37,One local authority identifies that residential and nursing homes are seeking a rise in fees of around 20% and another has experienced roughly a 10% increase in fees in each of the last two years.,?
124,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.43,"While uplifts are being factored into medium term financial planning, concerns remain about the likelihood of demands for higher increases and therefore further costs to local authorities.",?
125,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.45,"The survey indicates that the social care market remains fragile, and this has impacts for the long-term sustainability of the sector.",?
126,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.54,"It also reveals councils’ concerns about growing demand for both adults and children’s services, their capacity and resources available to meet these demands, along with reductions in quality and choice available.",?
127,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.5,The difficulty of recruiting and retaining care workers continues to be a major concern highlighted by councils.,?
128,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.52,In order to mitigate some of the recruitment and retention challenges some councils continue to have to rely on the use of agency staff and these costs further add to financial pressures in future years.,?
129,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.41,The survey highlights concerns that continue to be raised in relation to the provision of packages of care.,?
130,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.35,"Increased demand, along with a lack of suitable providers has previously been identified as an issue in the provision of domiciliary care.",?
131,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.73,"Local authorities identified an increase in the complexity of the care home packages needed to be put in place, alongside increasing costs meaning that councils can 3 Social care net revenue expenditure is budgeted at £2.302bn in (Source: Welsh Government RA Returns) struggle to have enough capacity to be able to meet the assessed need and ensure the sustainable provision of care.",?
132,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.42,"Issues in relation to access to Continuing Healthcare were also flagged meaning that local authorities were continuing to have to fund the majority, if not all, of these care packages rather than health.",?
133,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.62,"In addition, some authorities have referred to the financial impacts of Social Care ‘Tourism’ with clients moving over from England to benefit from the more generous capital threshold limits in Wales when moving into a care home setting and councils seeing individuals who have had delayed accessing healthcare and so now on presentation to social services have higher dependency requiring more costly care provision.",?
134,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.4,Councils also report seeing increased demand and complexity of cases in particular client groups.,?
135,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.41,"For example, pressures and costs in packages of care and support across mental health and learning disability services are identified in the survey responses.",?
136,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.33,One local authority pointed to the increasing numbers of under 65-year-olds with a learning disability requiring support which will continue to need to be met in future years.,?
137,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.55,The impacts of the cost-of-living crisis were highlighted as leading to rising pressures on families which has meant that some councils are experiencing increased numbers of children entering care.,?
138,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.21,Concerns continue to be highlighted over challenges finding appropriate and quality placements for children and young people.,?
139,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.31,"In particular, insufficient provision for children with complex needs with a lack of both fostering and residential placements available.",?
140,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.32,"Unprecedented levels of emergency placements for residential placements, increased use of independent placements and increased pressures to find foster placements were all highlighted with the cost of out of county placements continuing to rise and demand for specialised placements exceeding supply.",?
141,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.43,"Weekly costs of up to £20k per week for placements were identified and one local authority reported that their children's services budget has increased by £11m (56%) over the last 3 years, with specialist placement costs increasing by £6.6m (44%) over the same period.",?
142,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.43,The result of these existing placement and system pressures has meant the need for local authorities in some circumstances to have to consider the establishment of bespoke placement arrangements for children and young people that operate without registration under the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016.,?
143,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.45,"These types of placements place further pressures on local authorities, are expensive and direct funding away from prevention work into managing placements.",?
144,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.37,"In response councils are seeking to create their own in-house provision, but this takes time and resource to establish.",?
145,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.56,The survey responses also pointed towards some of the policy direction in Wales leading to increased financial pressures.,?
146,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.39,The commitment to eliminate private profit from the care of looked after children was highlighted as having a detrimental impact on the availability of placements with risks around the adequacy of the grant funding to fully cover transitional costs and the risk if the period of transition does not extend beyond the current funding period of identified.,?
147,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.42,Survey responses also recognised that the need to place children via the National Transfer Scheme (NTS) has increased cost pressures and has resulted in Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children (UASC) often being placed out of county/country to meet their identified needs which comes with significant cost pressures.,?
148,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.25,As a result of recent court judgements it was highlighted that this could mean there will be an increase in UASC's who will need to be placed in ever reducing numbers of placements.,?
149,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.49,Similarly concerns over the tapering of the Regional Integration Fund were raised with a reflection that any reductions in grant funding levels across social services will require reviews of service provision to be undertaken and the risk that service reduction proposals would need to be considered as part of this.,?
150,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.87,The implementation of the Real Living Wage for social care workers was also highlighted and that although funding is providing by Welsh Government to support this there is a need to further consider the effect of the price differential of senior staff/managers and concerns that funding is not keeping pace with the extra costs associated with implementing this policy with councils having to continue to support providers in being able to deliver this commitment.,?
151,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.5,One suggestion put forward by councils in response to some of the challenges being seen is the need to review the current maximum charge for non-residential care.,?
152,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.55,Earlier this year WLGA published research examining the challenges facing the social care sector and local government’s priorities for social care.,?
153,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.54,The research identified a system under enormous pressure due to: rapid demographic changes across Wales; the on-going impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; workforce challenges; funding difficulties; and the increase in the costs of living.,?
154,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.36,"Workforce issues topped the list of key concerns, alongside a lack of sustainable funding, and challenges associated with meeting more complex needs.",?
155,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.88,The financial estimates of the 22 Welsh councils further supports these conclusions but also raises the very real concern that with the scale of the financial challenges being faced the level of protection that has been afforded to social services to date will not be possible for much longer putting councils’ ability to successfully deliver social care services at risk in future years.,?
156,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.14,Ukraine and wider migration 44.,?
157,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.37,Wales is proud of its record in supporting people who have arrived seeking asylum and in welcoming refugees.,?
158,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.51,Local government works closely with the Welsh Government in achieving the ambition of Wales as a Nation of Sanctuary and in developing a place-based approach that best reflects contributions different areas can make.,?
159,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.61,"However, this work is not without its costs to councils and other public bodies and while asylum and migration are reserved matters, there is limited funding provided by the UK Government to cover costs incurred by councils.",?
160,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.63,"As highlighted in the section above, the National Transfer Scheme for unaccompanied children is a significant cost pressure on councils and while the Home Office provide some funding, this does not cover the full costs of care, particularly in relation to any complex cases and as the number of UASC cared for by Welsh councils increases, councils are losing out financially.",?
161,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.45,The funding for care leavers is also minimal and as this group increase this funding gap will increase as well.,?
162,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.53,"However, the biggest cost is from the full dispersal of asylum seekers across all Welsh councils but is more keenly seen in the long-standing asylum dispersal areas.",?
163,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.46,"The funding provided by the Home Office, recently introduced, is minimal, despite many impacts at the local level and services, for example, access to housing, schools, social services, advice and information.",?
164,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.48,"The recently introduced Streamlined Asylum Process as the Home Office aim to clear the backlog of asylum cases awaiting decisions, will significantly impact on Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Wrexham in terms of homelessness presentations and support services, which are already under immense strain at this time.",?
165,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.58,It is clear that councils are under funded by the UK Government for planning and responding to the impacts of asylum seekers being accommodated at the local level and it is likely this pressure will increase as full dispersal continues.,?
166,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.44,Housing and homelessness 48.,?
167,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.47,"Wales has continued with the approach of “no-one left out” in relation to homelessness, following the end of the public health emergency.",?
168,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.56,"This approach is supported by councils, however, the numbers of households approaching Councils for assistance has continued to increase.",?
169,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.55,This sustained increase in homelessness presentations to Councils in the period since the pandemic means that core homelessness services are overwhelmingly now dealing only with crisis and unable to work to prevent homelessness.,?
170,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.69,"The recently published White Paper on homelessness will also add additional financial pressures on councils and it is important that a robust and thorough assessment on the financial implications of any legislative proposals are undertaken, in partnership, so that appropriate levels of funding are provided in terms of implementation.",?
171,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.29,"The latest data reflects that there are currently more than 11,000 people in temporary accommodation.",?
172,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.82,This comes at a significant cost to council budgets and the level of funding provided by the Welsh Government is not keeping pace with such increased demand and the feedback from the survey undertaken reflects overspend on homelessness budgets and is an increasing financial pressure on councils.,?
173,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.5,One authority cited homelessness pressure contributing to a £660k overspend in the current year as demand outstripped the available budget.,?
174,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.6,"The Supporting People budget is also critical in supporting homeless people and those at risk, including funding for third sector bodies, and the WLGA stresses the need to maintain the current level of funding if additional funding is not available.",?
175,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.29,"Building more homes is essential to ensure that we have enough for everyone who needs them, when they are needed.",?
176,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.5,"Those Councils with housing stock are implementing ambitious new-build programmes, and seeking to acquire existing homes (often former Right to Buy properties) to increase the numbers of homes available for social rent, others are working with the RSL partners to ensure identified housing need is addressed.",?
177,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.45,All councils are also working with RSL partners to build new low carbon social rented homes.,?
178,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.52,It is therefore important to ensure that capital funding is available to support the building of social housing at the pace and scale needed to reduce reliance on temporary accommodation and ensure the housing needs of citizens in housing need can be met.,?
179,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.66,"Councils support the achievement of Welsh Government’s key housing objectives, set out in the Programme for Government, however, adequate funding is required to enable successful delivery.",?
180,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.51,"In addition to the above issues, other financial pressure in housing come from reform of the building safety regime, the revised Wales Housing Quality Standard, workforce pressures and meeting any gaps (for example the recent Audit Wales report on Building Control) and the ambitions in relation to decarbonisation of more homes.",?

187,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.18,"With the Bus Transition Fund (BTF) due to end in March 2024, bus services will need to revert to a combination of commercial and subsidised services from 1st April.",?

189,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.27,"However, with CF trips gradually rising post-Covid, the underspend is anticipated to be less in Whilst the increasing income from CF reimbursement will help operators, uncertainty over income on routes, combined with the need to give statutory notice of service cancellations, creates the risk further of service cuts.",?
190,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.57,An early indication of funding from Welsh Government for next year has been called for.,?
191,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.35,"It is likely that regional allocations will be made in the first instance to facilitate network planning, followed by tendering of subsidised routes by individual councils.",?
192,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.26,It is widely anticipated that tendered costs will be high due to increases in fuel and labour costs in particular.,?
193,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.26,This will also impact on home to school transport costs where significant increases are expected.,?
194,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.28,"Shortages of technical staff and HGV drivers and difficulties recruiting are impacting across all services in these areas, with staff being attracted away by higher salaries in other sectors.",?
195,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.21,"This also impacts on efforts to run apprenticeship schemes to draw in new people, as they can be tempted away once trained.",?
196,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.4,"As the work of, and expectations on, Corporate Joint Committees picks up, this is another source of financial pressure on councils.",?

199,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.54,"Welsh Government is planning to provide £125,000 to each region upon the production of RTP implementation plans but all regions have identified that further funding will be needed to take these plans forward in a meaningful way.",?
200,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.23,"New workplace regulations coming in from April 2024, which require the separate presentation of waste streams for collection, will increase costs for schools and council buildings.",?

204,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.3,Total costs were estimated at nearly £15bn for Great Britain as a whole.,?
205,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.4,"Other than use of a short-term Green Recovery Grant scheme, no additional funding has been made available to councils for this essential work.",?
206,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.1,Capital 59.,?
207,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.44,The survey also gathered evidence on capital programmes and pressures.,?
208,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.27,The responses indicate that a tightened revenue settlement will impact capital programmes.,?
209,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.35,"Across capital programmes we are seeing an increase in costs from when the programme was approved at feasibility stage, to the design and development stage of capital projects, due to the current inflation rates and volatility of the construction market.",?
210,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.18,"With little or no additional funding available, there has been a lot of reprioritising between schemes and scaling back schemes where possible.",?
211,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.33,"In relation to Twentieth Century Schools Band B Programme, many authorities are reporting a reduction in the number of schemes that are now affordable against what was anticipated when the programme was first set in line with the funding envelope.",?
212,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.45,"Following the completion of the Band A and the majority of Band B projects, councils are considering how sustainable it will be to continue to use borrowing, to support its percentage of the intervention rate going forward to the next iteration of the programme, given the impact of borrowing pressures on the Councils Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS).",?
213,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.29,Similar rationing will take place for the next WG Sustainable Communities programme.,?

218,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.16,"The re-profiling of schemes from prior years may affected the delivery works in year, resulting in a high level of carry forward requests to re- phase budgets into the programme.",?
219,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.22,"Additional grant funding from WG is always welcomed and appreciated, however volume of late notification of funding makes it more difficult to displace in year spend with grant.",?
220,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.32,More flexibility around when/how the grant needs to be spent would be beneficial.,?
221,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.53,"This would enable services with planning schemes to deliver value for money, and support with the pressing needs the Council are facing.",?
222,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.53,Any capital funding available for schemes that will help reduced revenue pressure around homelessness and out of county costs would also be welcomed.,?
223,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.37,The main source of funding is the Public Works Loan Board and long-term rates are currently around 5% although there is a lot of volatility in the markets.,?
224,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.35,This is significantly above rates when capital programmes were set in March 2022.,?
225,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.37,"This carries significant risk to affordability and sustainability, particularly in respect of housing schemes and extensive core asset infrastructure assumed to be paid for by borrowing.",?

227,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.45,Councils have made a number of commitments to contribute towards the target of net zero emissions in the public sector by 2030.,?
228,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.19,Many of the steps required involve capital investment (e.g.,?
229,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.06,"in relation to property and energy, fleet transition, land- based decarbonisation).",?
230,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.32,A wide range of funding streams will be required to make the sort of changes needed at the pace required.,?
231,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.27,That could include borrowing to meet upfront costs that will then have to be repaid from revenue budgets over a number of years.,?
232,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.22,It could also involve leasing or hire (e.g.,?
233,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.06,for vehicles) rather than a capital outlay.,?
234,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.3,"There are workforce implications that will need to be addressed, working with unions in a social partnership approach, including retraining and recruitment in many cases (e.g.",?

236,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.4,"Current labour shortages in many ‘green’ jobs in councils have highlighted not only the shortage of staff with the required skills but also wage differentials with the private sector, with retention of trained staff a growing issue.",?
237,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.32,"Other important measures relate to procurement, where councils need to reduce ‘Scope 3’ emissions, which relate (amongst other things) to their purchased goods and services.",?
238,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.22,"Where suppliers have developed carbon plans to reduce emissions associated with their goods and services, the direct costs will tend to be higher (although there are compensating environmental, and often social and wider economic benefits – e.g.",?
239,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.19,arising from local purchasing).,?
240,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.54,"At a time of significant financial pressure, it will be a challenge for councils to ‘do the right thing’ as opposed to choosing the most affordable option.",?
241,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.21,There will be a payback from climate change actions (in terms of adaptation as well as mitigation).,?
242,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.56,"However, the issues are, first, the timescales for that payback and, second, that many of the benefits do not accrue to the council in a direct or financial sense.",?
243,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.3,"Rather, they will often contribute to well-being goals for the wider community – for example more local jobs, healthier food, better quality environment, biodiversity gains, greater resilience against future extreme weather events.",?

248,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.53,"The UK Climate Change Committee has recently produced two important reports on progress in Wales, on mitigation and on adaptation that have financial implications for local government.",?
249,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.54,"On mitigation/reducing emissions it made the following points of relevance to councils (requiring a mix of capital and revenue measures): • Action on decarbonisation overall must accelerate • Progress on waste and recycling, whilst historically good in Wales, has stalled and needs to pick up • Greater effort is needed to transition to use of electric vehicles • There is a need for long term plans to decarbonise public buildings, social housing and fuel-poor homes • Tree planting and peatland restoration rates are too low, requiring capacity building and skills development 70.",?
250,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.47,"On adaptation/improving resilience to climate change it highlighted: • The changing climate has risks for infrastructure, ecosystems, communities and the economy • Around half of the 61 risks and opportunities it has identified for Wales require urgent action before Welsh Government’s next adaption plan is produced in 2024 • There is insufficient progress with implementation of measures and monitoring is poor, making it difficult to evaluate progress • There is a lack of clarity in responsibilities for responding to climate risks across the public sector • Unless climate risks are addressed, other societal goals will not be achieved.",?
251,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.23,The work of the task and finish groups is being informed by the UKCCC work.,?
252,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.32,Much of what needs to be done requires upfront capital and supportive revenue funding.,?
253,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.19,"However, in several cases there will be a financial return on investment as well as the carbon savings.",?
254,50 Welsh Local Government Association WGLA,,0.26,There are also more intangible ‘downstream’ financial savings in terms of preventing future spend having to respond to climate change impacts (e.g.,?
